                    <h1>My journey in becoming a front end developer.</h1>
                    <p class="para"> I'm currently halfway through the Scrimba Front-End Developer Career Path course, driven by my passion to become a proficient web developer.
                        This course has been instrumental in honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I aspire to leverage this knowledge to create engaging,
                        user-friendly websites and applications, ultimately pursuing a fulfilling career in web development.</p>

                    <h2>How I got started</h2>
                    <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning,
                        then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>How I stayed committed to learning</h2>
                    <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning.
                        After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short
                        summaries of what I learned using my own words.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>
